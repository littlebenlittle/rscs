# Rust Client-Service Framework

A framework for handling asynchronous communication between multiple clients and a single service.

## Status

This is a research project. I am learning about Rust's async system. Don't expect anything to work and do expect the project to be quite a mess for the foreseeable future.

See [`examples/echo_tcp.rs`](examples/tcp_echo.rs) for an initial example of a byte stream encoder/decoder over TCP.
